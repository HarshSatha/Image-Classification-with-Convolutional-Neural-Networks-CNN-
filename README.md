# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-

With the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computer vision has advanced significantly, especially in areas such as picture classification. CIFAR-10, a benchmark dataset with 60,000 color images in 10 classes, is one of the datasets used for these kinds of tasks. With 32 Ã— 32 pixels for each image, this presents a difficult yet extensively researched dataset for machine learning. Assigning labels to images based on learned characteristics is a key task in computer vision that is accomplished with CNNs for image classification. A basis for investigating CNN architectures and optimization strategies is provided by the CIFAR-10 dataset. We explore the process of creating an accurate CNN model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset in this project. Our goal is to investigate several approaches to model optimization and performance improvement, making a contribution to the progress of image categorization techniques. We aim to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in categorizing images across various categories by utilizing CNNs and novel methodologies, which promote advancements in computer vision research and applications.
